Welcome! 

## What we are reading

Our club is reading through the *Great Books*. Originally a seminar created by Robert Hutchins and Mortimer Adler at the University of Chicago in the 1940s, it now constitutes a list of some of the chief works of Western literature and history. You will likely know these works because they litter every library book sale and still hide in at least one of your neighbor's garages. To bring their seminar-style learning to the wider public, Hutchins and Adler founded The Great Books Foundation, and, with the help of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, published this mini library as *The Great Books of the Western World*. The Great Books Foundation still exists today, and it continues to publish udpated, single volume anthologies of these and more recent works, bringing them into current conversation (*Immigrant Voices: 21st Century Stories*, *Imperfect Ideal: Utopian and Dystopian Visions*, and *Her Own Accord: American Women on Identity, Culture and Community*; see [greatbooks.org](https://greatbooks.org)). 

Our book club is not associated with the Foundation; instead, we are simply a group of friends and new friends located in Springfield, Missouri who wish to enrich ourselves by reading great books and sharing in a great conversations with eachother. Some of us have already enjoyed the experience of a seminar style education in graduate school (some of us never finished ... oops). Some of us simply enjoy rich conversations with others while working in the garage or sitting on the back porch with friends and a cold beer. All of us value friends + books + ideas, whatever the context. The pandemic stifled these opporunities even after it was over in ways we didn't except. And none of us wish to pay $1000 for a graduate course just to experience it again. Luckily we believe in everyon's ability to engage with, learn from, and add to the *Great Conversation*. The list of books remains fixed only because Britannica no longer publishes the series; we, however, look forward to engaging with these works *and adding to them*. 

# How we gather

The group will choose one work from the list (or a collection of smaller works) and meet **once a month** at a time set in advance. Because we are adults with busy lives, once the time has been set, we do not change it. You must read the book in order to attend; but if you find that some months you don't finisht the work or can't make the meeting, fear not. That doesn't mean "you're out!" You can simply pick up for the next sessions, and in the meantime, you can engage in the conversation in other ways. 

In fact, this site was built with that goal in mind. Not only can you see what upcoming books we are reading (see [Calendar](/calendar.html), you can also read the fruit of our conversations in the posts on this site. Additionally, this site is publicly available and hosted on Github on. If you want to engage from afar, feel free to create a Github account and head over to the [Discussions](https://github.com/altuser6a/book_club/discussions) section, where we'll create a discussion post for each book we're reading. 

Finally, if you are of the writing type and wish to share the fruit of your reading, we are in the process of implmementing a system for our members to do so and easily receive feedback. All submissions, once merged into our repository, will be publicly available in plaintext and PDF format. (More on that below.)

## So, can I join?

Yes! *Membership is open to all.*

## Are these the only books worth reading?

No.

## Can I read other books?

We hope so. But the club itself meets to read and discuss the *Great Books*. As mentioned, we do want to add to this list, and we will implement a formal process for proposing additional works. This ensures that what we read next involves more than a single person's preferences. Approving a book, including the *Great Books*, makes nothing canon. It simply seeks to make manageable something that is already a lifelong task.

## Do I have to agree with the book I'm reading?

No. But, if you do disagree, even stronly disagree, we do hope you will read it first. The goal is education through reading and conversation about the *Great Ideas*, not indoctrination.

If in the end you choose not to read a book, we humbly suggest Pierre Bayard's (2007) *How to Talk About Books You Haven't Read*, which everyone should enjoy.

## Cool. How do I join this book club?

There are several ways:

- If you live locally in Springfield, Missouri, email `altuser6a` at (email) to introduce yourself and join the club.

- Alternatively, you can open an [Issue](https://github.com/altuser6a/book_club/issues) on the site's backend. 
  This will prompt you to create a Github account if you don't already have one. Using this method, you'll be set up to engage with our posts. Please title the issue "Join: \<your name or online alias\>" and introduce yourself; say whether you are local and want to join in person, or whether you'd just like to participate in the online discussion. It is public, so do not share your phone number on the site or any personal details you wouldn't want visible to the world wide web. 

After you have joined, be sure to check the Calendar linked at the top of this page, and any announcements on the backend [Discussion](https://github.com/altuser6a/book_club/discussions) page.

## Now that I've joined, where do I start?

Start by looking at what book we're reading next. When we post the upcoming books, we'll also post links to what version we're reading and where it can be ordered on Amazon. Purchase it wherever is most suitable to you. While `altuser6a` owns the entire Britannica series, he can definitely say that there are much better and more recent versions published. For anoyone who can't purchase the version we're reading, all of the books in the series are in the public domain, and we will provide linsk to those, too.

On top of the book we're reading, we highly encourage every member to at some point read Mortimer Adler's [*How to Read a Book*](https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Classic-Intelligent/dp/0671212095). The typical American highschool education still ends with most students only knowing how to read at an elementary level; that is, they can read words on a page and comprehend some of what they're reading. This is not the level of reading we'll be engaging in. Adler's book is a great guide in how to read several levels higher. It details inspectional reading (your greatest friend, if you've never done it), analytical reading, and synoptic reading.

Additionally, when we meet, our club will be using the *Shared Inquiry* method designed by the Great Books Foundation. You can find their guide hosted [here](). In fact, this is a great place to start, even if you haven't read Adler's book.
